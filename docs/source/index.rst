What is shogi?
==============

Shogi, also known as Japanese chess, is a two-player strategy board game native to Japan. The shogi board has nine by nine squares, and there are eight different piece types. It is said that such pieces were invented as early as the 12th century, yet the present form was established in the 16th century. One of the rules that distinguish shogi from other chess variants is the drop rule. It allows captured pieces to be returned to the board by the capturing player.

Shogi has been the most popular board game in Japan for centuries (in fact, much more popular than Western chess), and professionals have been greatly respected by all Japanese population. Recently, the first non-Japanese shogi professional `Karolina Styczyńska <https://www.shogi.or.jp/player/lady/59.html>`_ and the progeny `Sota Fujii <https://www.shogi.or.jp/player/pro/307.html>`_ have made headlines many times, acquiring new shogi fans all over the world.

Please refer to `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi>`_ for further information.

As you move pieces and change positions on the board, Shogi Playground issues different URLs for each position. You may create a shortened URL for free, which is quite handy for sharing with the audience of your social networks. (As a bonus, this shortened URL comes with a nice thumbnail image on Twitter and Facebook!) As far as I know, Shogi Playground is the first website that has employed the idea of **Shogi Record as a URL**.
