=============
Customization
=============

In the **Settings** menu, there are several options for customizing the look and feel of the shogi board. The settings will be saved for your browser, specifically in Local Storage. That is, you will need to set options for each device/browser, and settings will be reset when you clear Local Storage on your browser.


Board size
==========

By default, the board size is automatically adjusted to your screen. You may optionally fix the board size, from ``15 - Extra Small`` to ``60 - Extra Large``. Here the number (15, ..., 60) represents the width in pixels of each square on board.


Layout
======

You can choose one of board layouts as you prefer.


Piece graphic
=============

You can change piece graphic.


Board background
================

You can change the color of the board background.


Coordinates
===========

You can choose the style of the rank-wise coordinate.


Double Board mode
=================

If you enable the Double Board mode, two shogi boards are shown in the main pane. The right one is flipped so you can see White's view. On a mobile screen, this feature is available only when the screen orientation is **portrait**.


Visual effects
==============

You can disable or enable visual effects. Examples of visual effects are:

- flash of movable positions when you choose a piece
- promotion animation

This feature is **on** by default but will be disabled on some browsers such as Internet Explorer.


Sound effects
=============

You can disable or enable sound effects. Examples of sound effects are:

- selection of a piece
- movement of a piece
- flipping the board

This feature is **off** by default not to surprise you.
